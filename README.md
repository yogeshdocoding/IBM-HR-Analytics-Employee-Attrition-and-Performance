# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-and-Performance
Welcome to the **IBM HR Analytics** project!
This project explores key factors behind employee attrition at IBM using data-driven insights, with the goal of helping HR teams understand what drives turnover and how to reduce it effectively.

## 🔍 Project Objective

Employee attrition poses significant challenges for organizations — from increased hiring costs to loss of skilled talent.
In this project, we analyze IBM’s HR dataset to uncover **what makes employees leave** and provide **actionable recommendations** to retain them.


## 📁 Dataset

* **Source**: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset
* **Content**: Includes demographic, work-related, and performance attributes of employees

> The dataset is analyzed using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🧠 Key Insights

Based on our analysis, the following factors were found to significantly influence attrition:

* **Low Salary**: Employees earning below-average wages are more likely to leave.
* **Long Commute**: Employees with longer distances from home to work show higher dissatisfaction.
* **Excessive Overtime**: Leads to stress and burnout, increasing the likelihood of resignation.
* **Limited Career Growth**: Lack of promotions or upskilling opportunities pushes employees to explore alternatives.
* **Poor Work-Life Balance**: A major driver for employees leaving the company.
* **New Hires**: Recent joiners show higher attrition, often due to poor onboarding or culture mismatch.
* **High Performers**: Attract competing job offers more frequently and are at higher risk of leaving.
